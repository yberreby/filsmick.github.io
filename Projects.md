## SEC (Self Employed Calculator)
A simple script for the website [Autoentrepreneur.fr](http://autoentrepreneur.fr), that calculates your income limit at the date of status declaration. I didn't pushed it on GitHub because it's a private project, only for this website, but you can use use it without modifying or distributing it. [It's here (in french)](http://autoentrepreneur.fr), in a box in the sidebar, "Votre chiffre d'affaire autoris√©".  
**Stage: Released**

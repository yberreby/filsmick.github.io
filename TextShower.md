### TextShower live example

Here's an example of what TextShower can do. Check the source of this page if you want!

<div class="TextShower-box"> 
<strong class="TextShower-title">Hey, I'm a title! Click me!</strong> 
<p class="TextShower-text">I'm the content of this box. But what if the user has no JavaScript? Well, by default I'm unfolded, so he can still see me.</p>
</div>

<p>I'm a simple paragraph. I'm dynamically moved as the textbox above me unfolds.</p>

<div class="TextShower-box"> 
<strong class="TextShower-title">I'm another title !</strong> 
<p class="TextShower-text">My title doesn't have a '+' in it if there is no Javascript. But if there is and you click it, it will become a '-'! You can customize that in the arguments.<br>
Div, strong and p are the most suitable HTML tags to use.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The margin, the padding and the height are animated. </p>
